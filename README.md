# Madrasa-Management-System
Introduction <br>
Education institutions such as Madrasas and Schools require efficient management of data, including student records, fee collection, attendance, and administrative tasks. Traditionally, these operations are maintained in physical registers, which is time-consuming, error-prone, and difficult to manage. To address these issues, this project proposes the development of a web-based management system that automates and streamlines the administrative processes of schools and madrasas. located in village kalakot.
